      "A large body of research has documented high rates of sexual fluidity, and sexual identity-behavior discordance among women. Less research, however, has connected these findings to potential sexual orientation disparities in contraception uptake and unintended pregnancy risk. Using data from three sources sources, this presentation investigates sexual orientation disparities in a variety of sexual and reproductive health outcomes related to unintended pregnancy, including patterns of contraception preferences and uptake. Ultimately, this research seeks to build a bridge between the fields of Sexuality Studies and Family Planning to develop strategies to address sexual minority women’s reproductive health needs.",
